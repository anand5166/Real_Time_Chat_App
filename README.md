**Customizable:** Easily modify the server, ports, and other configurations.



**📋 Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your system. While the app works on various Node.js versions, we recommend using the latest LTS release for optimal performance. The app 
has been tested with Node.js **10.16.3** or later.

🖥️ **Running the App**

To start the app in development mode, run the following command:

       npm run dev

This will launch the app on **http://localhost:3000**, where you can access the chat interface in your browser. Nodemon will automatically restart the server when any changes are made.



🔧 **Customizing the Port**

To change the default port (3000), duplicate **.env.example** and rename it to **.env**. Set your desired port within this file:

      PORT=your_port_number

Restart the app to apply the changes.
